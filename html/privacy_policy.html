                <h3>
                    General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a)
                    GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories
                    of data pursuant to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of
                    personal data to third countries,
                    data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies
                    or
                    access to information on your device
                    (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on § 25(1) TDDDG. Consent
                    can
                    be revoked at any time.
                    If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of
                    pre-contractual
                    measures,
                    we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is
                    necessary to
                    fulfill a legal obligation
                    based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interests under Art.
                    6(1)(f) GDPR.
                    Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case can be found in the following
                    sections
                    of this privacy policy.
                </p>

                <h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
                <p>
                    In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties.
                    In some cases, the transfer of personal data to these external parties is necessary.
                    We only disclose personal data to external parties if this is required for the fulfillment of a
                    contract,
                    if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., disclosure to tax authorities),
                    if we have a legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR in the disclosure,
                    or if another legal basis permits the data transfer.
                    When using processors, we only transfer our customers' personal data on the basis of a valid data
                    processing agreement.
                    In the case of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
                </p>
                <h3>Withdrawal of your consent to data processing</h3>
                <p>
                    Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent.
                    You can revoke consent that you have already given at any time.
                    The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the
                    revocation.

                    THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
                    IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE
                    COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS
                    OR THE PROCESSING SERVES TO ESTABLISH, EXERCISE OR DEFEND LEGAL CLAIMS
                    (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
                </p>
                <p>
                    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT
                    ANY
                    TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING PURPOSES;
                    THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING.
                    IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES
                    (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).

                    In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a
                    supervisory authority,

                    alleged
                    infringement.
                    The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

                    of a contract,
                    in a common, machine-readable format and to have it transmitted to yourself or a third party.
                    If you request the direct transfer of data to another controller, this will only be done as far as
                    it is
                    technically feasible.
                </p>

                    to obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin, recipients, and the purpose
                    of
                    data processing,
                    as well as the right to request correction or deletion of this data.

                <p>
                    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
                    You can contact us at any time for this. The right to restriction of processing exists in the
                    following
                    cases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us,
                        we generally need time to verify this. During the verification period,
                        you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data
                        processing instead of deletion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend, or assert legal
                        claims, you have the right to request the restriction of processing instead of deletion of your
                        personal data.

                        your
                        interests and ours. As long as it is not yet determined whose interests prevail, you have the

                    aside
                    from their storage – with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or
                    to
